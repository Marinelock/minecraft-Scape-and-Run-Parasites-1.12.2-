# minecraft-Scape-and-Run-Parasites-1.12.2-
This mod adds hostile parasite-themed mobs to your Minecraft game for you to fight, they can be dangerous, scary and some of them can learn from their fights to evolve.  They have no biome specific spawn, so you can find them anywhere. The parasites don't burn in daylight and they can attack other hostile mobs.

Reinforcement System:

When a parasite is killed, there is a chance for it to call reinforcements, this means that a Beckon will spawn nearby and will help in the fight. The Beckon has different stages and that will tell how many and which parasites it will spawn. You can change the Beckon mob spawning in the configuration file

The beckons also have the ability to infest nearby blocks, infested blocks can damage all mobs other than the parasite faction, you can change values like "maximum block hardness to infest block", "light level to spread to other block" and more in the configuration file.

Merge System:

The infected have the ability to learn from their battles and if the conditions are met, they will start to melt until they're some Moving Flesh.
If 2 of these things meet, they will fuse together and grow, if they get big enough they will spawn a primitive mob (with half his total health) (Infected Dorpa is the only one that will not melt).

Conditions for the infected to turn into Moving Flesh:

-The first condition: the infected needs to reach the primitive killcount..
-The second condition: it needs to be next to 3 more infected, regardless of their killcount/specie OR it needs to be next to a Moving Flesh.
If the infected with the killcount is next to atleast 3 more infected, the four of them will start to melt BUT if it is next to a Moving flesh, only it will start to melt.
