# minecraft-Scape-and-Run-Parasites-1.12.2-
This mod adds hostile parasite-themed mobs to your Minecraft game for you to fight, they can be dangerous, scary and some of them can learn from their fights to evolve.  They have no biome specific spawn, so you can find them anywhere. The parasites don't burn in daylight and they can attack other hostile mobs.
